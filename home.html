      <br>

      Development is a simple react.js app with filtering and sorting system with an aggregator. In this app, I created a list of kdramas and let users find and shop their favorite dramas.

          The goal of this app is to create a react.js app with sorting, filtering, and aggregator application with states and components.
          <br>
          <br> 
          The value of this app is to allow users to find and shop their favorite kdramas with filtering and sorting functionalities.

        <b>Usability Principles Considered</b>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Some usability principles that I considered are simplicity and consistency. For simplicity, I used navigation bar on the top
          to let sort and filter easily. For consistency, I used same design for all the add/remove cart buttons and all filtering options
          in the navigation bar.

        <b>Assignment Feedback</b>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        This was my first time using Javascript and React, so even though there was a lot to cover, I think it was worth it and useful.
        The assignment was overall interesting and learned a lot, especially with adding functionalities in websites and how to structure
        the program.
